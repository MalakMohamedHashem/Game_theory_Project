# 🎮 Game Theory Simulation Project

This project is a simulation-based toolkit built with Python to model and analyze classic **Game Theory** problems. The system includes implementations of fundamental games along with utilities for analysis and visualization of strategic decisions.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Simulate classical games from Game Theory.
- Analyze strategies and outcomes.
- Provide reusable components to build and study custom games.

## 🧠 Included Games

The project includes implementations of the following well-known games:

- **Prisoner's Dilemma** – Cooperation vs Defection strategy analysis.
- **Hawk-Dove** – Conflict resolution in evolutionary biology.
- **Battle of the Sexes** – Coordination with conflicting interests.
- **Matching Pennies** – Pure strategy vs mixed strategy balance.
